# ignition

Ignition is an app that lets you manage your autostart entries on Freedesktop-compliant Linux distros.
Autostart entries are simply .desktop entries placed within ~/.config/autostart (or wherever you have .config set), but there aren't many great graphical tools for creating or editing these entries on the GNOME desktop.
With Ignition, not only can you add any installed app to be ran at login, but you can also add arbitrary commands, or custom scripts too!
